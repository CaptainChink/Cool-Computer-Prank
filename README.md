# Cool-Computer-Prank
This is a simple little computer prank to pull on friends and other people. 
They will think that they are being hacked or getting a computer virus. 

To work correctly:
  -Leave out of a folder(on a hard drive or on the desktop)
  -Open the "Open Me ONLY.bat" file to start it
  -Do not open the other files
  -Do not tamper with the order of the script of the .bat file unless you know what you are doing
